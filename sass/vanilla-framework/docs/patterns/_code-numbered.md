The code numbered pattern can be used when displaying large blocks of code to enable users to quickly reference a specific line.

Code numbered extends the [base styling of code](/base/code/).

See also: [code snippet](/patterns/code-snippet/).

<pre class="p-code-numbered">
    <code>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 1</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 2</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 3</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 4</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 5</span>
    </code>
</pre>

```html
<pre class="p-code-numbered">
    <code>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 1</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 2</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 3</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 4</span>
<span class="code-line">this is a code sample line 5</span>
