The `.u-off-screen` class will position an element out of the page flow and off-screen, while still making it available to screen readers.

```html
<div class="u-off-screen">
    To hear a great joke, navigate this page with your favorite screen reader.
</div>
```

<div class="u-off-screen">
    Two CSS properties walk into a bar. A barstool in a completely different bar falls over.
</div>
